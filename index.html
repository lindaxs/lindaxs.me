      <h1 id="about-me">About me.</h1>
      <p>I'm from San Jose, CA; the suburby city in Silicon Valley filled with good food and good friends. I live Northern San Jose, close to the Piedmont Hills that turn from yellow to green within days (almost) every spring. I grew up in California, surrounded by amazing women in STEM and the endless limits of technology
      </p>
      <h1 id="why-dali">Why Dali?</h1>
      <p> Although I've strayed from the Silicon Valley bubble, I find DALI to be its own CS community, full of people willing to impart knowledge and experience even to those for who have no experience at all. From the expositions to the tutorials, DALI continues to reinvigorate an awe for the possibilities of technology.

      <h1 id="trivia">Trivia!?</h1>
      <p> &bull; I love trivia, although I have never won or come close to winning a trivia game. 
      </p>
      <p> &bull; If I can get away with it not being too tangled, I don't brush my hair.
      </p>
      <p> &bull; I'm left handed but play some sports including basketball and cut using a knife with my right hand.
